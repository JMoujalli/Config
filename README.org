* About

My dotfiles that I generally use with Arch linux (Maybe Debian).

* Installation

Clone the repository into: ~/dotfiles

Make symlinks using:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  cd ~/dotfiles
  stow -nvSt ~ i3 emacs
  stow -vSt ~ i3 emacs
#+END_SRC

To remove the symlinks:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  cd ~/dotfiles
  stow -nvDt ~ i3 emacs
  stow -vDt ~ i3 emacs
#+END_SRC

* Warning
These files are a work in progress and may not necessarily work for your system at any given time.

* TODO:
- Simplify mode line.
  Currently, depending on the filetype, the mode line has too much information.
- Experiment with email in emacs. notmuch, mu4e, etc.
- Literate init file would be interesting.
